# Customer-segmentation-with-hierarchical-clustering-and-KNN
This project employs a hybrid segmentation system where Agglomerative Clustering first identifies customer groups from market data. These derived labels then train a KNN model, enabling the system to efficiently predict segments for new customers based on the established cluster patterns.
